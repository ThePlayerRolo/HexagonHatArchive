You may be wondering, why is there a edited version by me in this archive?
Well you see, the orignal version of this model  is 7k VERTICES!
And if you use a simple merge by distance in blender, it goes down to 2K Vertices with no visible difference.
So um, I'm adding the edited version for my own sanity.
Also Note: The Original OBJ might is also displaced upward in the file istelf and not by a hat object. 
The edited Version moves it to the origin to help making it a proper hat easier.
