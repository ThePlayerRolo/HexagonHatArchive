# HexagonHatArchive
An Archive Of Some Hexagon Hats, Faces, And Gear, Shirts, And Pants. Before It Shutdown.
<br>
Some hats have the rbxms, others only the meshes and textures.
<br>
Faces are only PNGS
<br>
TheArbiter Folder has mostly gear rbxm's but not all the other assets (Currently Working On This)
<br>
Qwertys  and The Fat Ugly Section contain OBJ and MTL's  as well.
