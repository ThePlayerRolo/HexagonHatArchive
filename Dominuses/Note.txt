Most of the items in this section use the Same Mesh, but Different Textures and RBXM's (and luas!) for effects and other stuff.
However, the Blocky Dominus uses a different mesh, so you can find that mesh and its texture in its folder.
Intresting enough, the original V2 Cat Dominus mesh displays incorrectly when using a dominus rbxm (the one from Novetus), being the Wrong Direction and a little displaced.
Its found in the Cat Dominus Folder if you want to view that.
